 And I cant sweep you off of your feet
 Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
 Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks

 <u>And darling I will be loving you till we're 70</u>
 And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
 And Im thinking bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
 Maybe just the touch of a hand
 Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
 And I just wanna tell you I am

<h1> So honey now</h1>
 <strong>Take me into your loving arms</strong>
 Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
 Place your head on my beating heart
 Im thinking out loud
 That maybe we found love right where we are

 When my hairs overgone and my memory fades
 And the crowds dont remember my name
 When my hands dont play the strings the same way
 I know you will still love me the same

 Cause honey your soul can never grow old, its evergreen
 Baby your smiles forever in my mind and memory
 Im thinking bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways

 Maybe its all part of a plan
 I just keep on making the same mistakes
 Hoping that youll understand

 But baby now
 Take me into your loving arms
 Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
 Place your head on my beating heart
 Thinking out loud
 That maybe we found love right where we are

 So baby now

 Take me into your loving arms
 Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
 Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
 Im thinking out loud
 That maybe we found love right where we are
 Oh maybe we found love right where we are
 And we found love right where we are
